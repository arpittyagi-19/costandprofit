        <h1>Cost and Profitability Model: Theory</h1>
        <p>
            In this project, we develop a comprehensive cost and profitability model
            for a food delivery service. The model takes into account various factors
            such as delivery fees, payment processing fees, discounts, and commission
            rates. By analyzing these factors, we can estimate the actual profitability
            of the service and make recommendations for optimizing rates to maximize
            profit margins.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, which allows for easy
            modification and experimentation with different scenarios. The notebook
            includes code for calculating costs, profits, and visualizing the results.

Swiggy is the major competitor in India, offering the same services as Zomato. But Zomato is ahead of Swiggy with respect to its AOV(Average Order Value) by Rs 35 according to a 2020 Goldman Sachs report. This gives Zomato a shot in the arm to break even and be profitable as the higher the AOV higher the margins. The importance of high AOV will be explained in the later section.

Zomato Hyper pure is another jewel in its crown, providing groceries to restaurants. For a B2C company, this is a new avenue and another vertical to make money. Zomato wants to be an end-to-end provider for the food industry. Restaurants need anywhere between 50-100 ingredients daily and even if Hyperpure can tap into 10% of the market it will be a huge gain in terms of revenue. FY20 Revenue stood at 14.7M compared to 1.8M in FY19 a multifold increase, as more and more restaurants adopt this new sourcing platform, net positive contribution from this vertical is bound to increase. Local mandi’s and traders are Zomato’s real competition in this space, and right now the traders are winning this race according to the latest reports from Inc42. Restaurants that buy from Hyperpure are recognized through a ‘Hyperpure Inside’ tag.

<h2>Process for Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.</li>
    <li>Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.</li>
    <li>Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.</li>
    <li>Break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).</li>
    <li>Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.</li>
    <li>For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.</li>
    <li>Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.</li>
    <li>Use the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.</li>
